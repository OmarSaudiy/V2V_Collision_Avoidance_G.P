# Project Title: V2V Collision Avoidance
# Overview:
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for the V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) collision avoidance project developed as part of the graduation project sponsored by Valeo. The goal of this project is to create a proof-of-concept system for V2V collision avoidance, which helps vehicles communicate with each other and avoid collisions.

# Features:
Communication between two or more vehicles using Valeo's V2V technology.
Detection and warning of potential collisions in real-time using five real-life scenarios:
Electronics Emergency Brake Light (EEBL)
Forward Collision Warning (FCW)
Blind Spot Warning (BSW)
Don't Pass Warning (DPW)
Intersection Movement Assist (IMA)
Integration with Ultrasonic and other sensors to ensure accurate detection and warning.
Embedded Linux-based system utilizing the Yocto Project for optimized performance.
Custom distribution and image created for seamless integration of modules and applications.
User-friendly interface to display received data and alerts.
Data encryption and authentication for secure communication.
Technologies Used:
Valeo's V2V technology
C++ programming language
Qt Framework
Embedded Linux
Yocto Project
Ultrasonic and other sensors
