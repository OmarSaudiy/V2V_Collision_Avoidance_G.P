# Project Title: V2V Collision Avoidance
# Overview:
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for the V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) collision avoidance project developed as part of the graduation project sponsored by Valeo. The goal of this project is to create a proof-of-concept system for V2V collision avoidance, which helps vehicles communicate with each other and avoid collisions.

# Features:
- Communication between two or more vehicles using Valeo's V2V technology.  </p>
- Detection and warning of potential collisions in real-time using five real-life scenarios:
  - Electronics Emergency Brake Light (EEBL).  </p>
  - Forward Collision Warning (FCW).  </p>
  - Blind Spot Warning (BSW).  </p>
  - Don't Pass Warning (DPW).  </p>
  - Intersection Movement Assist (IMA).  </p>
- Integration with Ultrasonic and other sensors to ensure accurate detection and warning.  </p>
- Embedded Linux-based system utilizing the Yocto Project for optimized performance.  </p>
- Custom distribution and image created for seamless integration of modules and applications.  </p>
- User-friendly interface to display received data and alerts.  </p>

# Technologies Used:
- V2V technology.
- C programming language.
- Embedded Linux.
- Yocto Project.
- Interfacing with Ultrasonic and many other sensors.
